1. Understanding problem statements.
2. Coming up with test cases:
Test Cases:

test case1:
input:
5 7
output:
12
test case2:
input:
8 9
output:
5
test case3:
input:
9 10
output:
7
test case4:
input:
1 2
output:
3

3. Coming up with logic:
Algo
1. Read the space separated input, and store it in two variables- say num1 and num2.
2. Calculate the sum of num1 and num2.
3. If the sum is less than 12, print it.
4. If it is greater than 12,print sum - 12.
